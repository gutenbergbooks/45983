<h2 class="nopagebreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE.</span></h2>


<p>One day in the early spring, Alice Winter came
home from school, and, after the usual question
at the door, "Is mamma at home?" rushed
upstairs, and found to her great surprise that her
papa was at home, talking very earnestly to Mrs.
Winter.</p>

<p>When Alice came into the room, Mr. Winter
stopped talking, and she wondered very much what
they could have been talking about so earnestly, as
all she heard was her papa asking, "Do you think
we had better take her with us?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_012" title="12"> </a>
"Why, papa! What is the matter? Are you
going away? Are you sick? What made you come
home so early?" were the questions which Alice
gave rapidly, without waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said, "Yes, dear, I am obliged to go
to Nuremberg, Germany, on business immediately,
and mamma is trying to make up her mind
whether it is best for her to go with me. She
does not like to leave you for so long a time, and
we do not think it wise to take you with us,
when you are getting on at school so nicely."</p>

<p>"O papa, please take me with you. I shall
learn just as much on such a lovely trip as at
school, and you know I can take care of mamma,
and keep her from being lonely when you are busy.
O papa, please ask mamma to let me go. I
should be so unhappy to stay without you, even
with dear Aunt Edith, and I know there is where
you would send me."</p>

<p>"Alice, dear, go to your room and get ready for
dinner, and leave us to talk it over," said Mr.
Winter. "My dear little daughter knows that no
<a class="pagenum" name="page_013" title="13"> </a>
matter which way we decide, it will be as we
think is best for all of us. You know it is as
hard for us to leave you as it will be for you to
let us go."</p>

<p>Alice left the room without another word, with her
heart beating very fast from the excitement of it all.</p>

<p>The thought of going to Europe across the great
ocean was a very happy one to a bright girl of
fifteen who was studying all the time about the
places she would visit and the objects of interest
she would see, if her papa would only decide to
take her.</p>

<p>Alice sat down by the window of her pretty
room, and looked out on the village street, far away
in the northern part of the State of New York.
She wondered how the ocean looked, as she had
never seen any larger body of water than that of
Lake Erie, when she went with her mother to make
a visit in Cleveland.</p>

<p>She also wondered if her state-room on the
steamer would be as large as the room she was in;
also, would she be sick, and how would all those
<a class="pagenum" name="page_014" title="14"> </a>
wonderful cities look; if they could be as beautiful
as the pictures she had seen of them.</p>

<p>Then she remembered that only last week she had
been studying about the quaint old city of Nuremberg,
and wishing she could go there and see all
its curiosities.</p>

<p>Alice was startled by the dinner-bell, and could
not even wait to brush her hair, she was so anxious
to know what her papa had decided.</p>

<p>As Alice went into the dining-room with a very
wistful look in her deep-brown eyes, Mr. Winter
said, "Well, dear, we have decided to take you
with us, and as it is now Wednesday, and we sail
Saturday from New York on the 'Etruria,' you
will be very busy getting ready, and you must help
your mamma all you can."</p>

<p>Alice threw her arms around Mr. Winter's neck,
crying with joy, saying at the same time, "Oh, you
dear, darling papa, how kind and good you are, and
how I do love you!"</p>

<p>After kissing him again and again, she went to
her mamma and nearly smothered her with kisses.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_015" title="15"> </a>
Mr. Winter had never been abroad, though he had
large business interests there, which had been attended
to by a clerk in whom he had the utmost
confidence. This clerk had been taken very suddenly
and dangerously ill, Mr. Winter had no one
else he could send, and found he must go himself
and at once.</p>

<p>He telegraphed to the Cunard office for state-rooms,
and went home to tell his wife, hardly
thinking she would go with him at such short
notice, or leave Alice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter was not willing he should go without
her, and soon decided not only to go, but to
take Alice with them.</p>

<p>Alice could hardly eat any dinner, she was so
happy and full of excitement.</p>

<p>The next morning Alice went to school to get
her books and tell the wonderful news to her
teacher and school-mates.</p>

<p>They were nearly as interested as she, for it was
quite an event for any one to go to Europe from
that quiet village.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_016" title="16"> </a>
It was decided then and there that all would be
at the station to see her off on Friday.</p>

<p>When Alice went to her room she found there a
new steamer-trunk marked "A.&nbsp;W." in large letters,
and then she was busy indeed getting it
packed and deciding what to take with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter came in while Alice was almost in
despair and said, "This is to be such a hurried
trip you will need only a couple of dresses, but
you must take all your warm wraps."</p>

<p>Alice laughed and said, "I do not think I shall need
them in the spring;" but mamma said, "It is always
cold at sea, and you will need your winter clothes."</p>

<p>Friday afternoon our little party started for New
York, with the best wishes of their friends, who
came to the station for the very last "good-byes."
Alice even shed a few tears, but they were soon
wiped away, and a happy face looked from the car
window, which fortunately was on the side overlooking
the Hudson River.</p>

<p>Alice had never seen that lovely river before, and
naturally was delighted.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_017" title="17"> </a>
When they passed the Catskill Mountains it was
so clear she could see the famous old Mountain
House, and, beyond, the immense Kauterskill Hotel,
which seemed almost in the clouds, it looked so
high.</p>

<p>West Point was the next object of interest, and
Alice did hope she could go there sometime and
see the cadets do some of their drills.</p>

<p>When they were opposite the Palisades, which
stood up in their grandeur, with the softened
tints of the setting sun settling upon them, Alice
said, "I know I shall see nothing in Europe any
finer than that."</p>

<p>Very soon the tall spires and smoke in the distance
showed that they were drawing near New
York, and after leaving the Hudson they followed
the pretty Harlem River, which makes an island of
New York City.</p>

<p>Alice was much interested in the bridges, there
seemed to be so many of them, and papa told her
that the one then in sight was the new Washington
bridge, just completed. The next was High
<a class="pagenum" name="page_018" title="18"> </a>
bridge, which carries the water over the river into
the city. When it was finished it was said to be
the finest engineering in the country.</p>

<p>The next bridge was the continuation of the elevated
railroad, and then came Macomb's Dam bridge,
the oldest of them all, and used simply for driving
and walking across, and looked, Alice thought, quite
unsafe.</p>

<p>The pretty Madison Avenue bridge was the last
they saw as they crossed their own bridge, and were
soon in a tunnel which Alice thought would never
end.</p>

<p>When they came out of the tunnel the train was
nearly at the station, where the noise and bustle
were very confusing, and they were glad to get
into a carriage to be driven to the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.</p>

<p>As it was quite dark, Alice thought it was like
a glimpse of fairyland when they reached Madison
Square, with its electric lights shining on the trees,
and all the bright lights around the hotel.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_019" title="19"> </a>
CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="small">NEW YORK FOR THE FIRST TIME.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Winter having telegraphed for rooms, found
them ready for him; and on going down to
dinner they were delighted to see the corridors and
dining-room crowded with people, many of them public
characters whom he could point out to Alice,
who was so excited she felt the entire evening as
if she were in a dream.</p>

<p>Of all the prominent men there Alice was the
most interested in General Sherman, with his kind,
rugged face.</p>

<p>The "Etruria" sailed at noon on Saturday, and Mrs.
Winter and Alice spent the morning buying a few
last things, such as a hat and hood and comfortable
steamer-chairs.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock a Fifth Avenue Hotel stage was
at the door, and several people beside themselves
<a class="pagenum" name="page_020" title="20"> </a>
went in it to the steamer. The ladies had flowers
and baskets of fruit, and seemed so bright and
happy that Alice for the first time felt a little lonely
and homesick.</p>

<p>On reaching the dock there were so many people
going on and coming off the steamer, and pushing
each other, it was almost impossible to cross the
gang-plank and reach their own state-rooms.</p>

<p>Finally they found them, and, instead of nice large
rooms, they were so very small that Alice felt she
never could live in them for a week or ten days,
and the berths were so narrow she said, "O papa,
you can never get into one of those in the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can," said Mr. Winter, "and perhaps
before we reach Liverpool I shall wish they were
narrower yet."'</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter and Alice had one room, and Mr.
Winter was across the passage with another gentleman.</p>

<p>After settling their valises and rugs they went
up on deck to see the people, and also the last of
the city itself. Large baskets of fruits and flowers
<a class="pagenum" name="page_021" title="21"> </a>
in every shape were constantly being brought on
board, and much to Alice's delight there was a large
bunch of violets from her school friends at home.</p>

<p>She had been looking at the other people a little
enviously, especially at a girl of her own age who
had many friends to see her, and her arms full of
flowers.</p>

<p>Very soon the gong sounded, and Alice, who had
never heard one, put her hands to her ears to shut
out the noise. As soon as the man had passed by
Alice said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"That is a gong, dear," said her papa, "and is
now being used to notify the people who are not
sailing on the steamer that it is time to go
ashore."</p>

<p>The people who left kissed their friends hurriedly,
and went down the gang-plank as if afraid they
might be carried away, after all.</p>

<p>After the people were on the dock and the mailbags
had been put on the steamer, very slowly but
surely the great steamer backed out into the river.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_022" title="22"> </a>
Tugs turned her around, and carefully she steamed
toward the ocean, trying to avoid the many boats
moving about the river in all directions.</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <p class="caption">
  THE GREAT STEAMER BACKED OUT INTO THE RIVER.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_021">21</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Alice was rather frightened, and thought they certainly
would run into some of them.</p>

<p>Many of the passengers were still waving to their
friends, who were also waving to them from the
dock as long as they could distinguish it at all.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_023" title="23"> </a>
Very soon they could see the famous statue of the
Goddess of Liberty, that holds its light so high in
the air; then lovely Staten Island, with its green
hills and fine houses.</p>

<p>The two forts, Hamilton and Wordsworth, which
guard the entrance to the harbor, were soon left
behind, and on the left could be seen Coney Island,
with its large hotels and elephant and high elevator.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they were looking at the largest
hotel of all, the one at Rockaway Beach, the
steamer stopped. Alice, rather startled, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"They are going to drop the pilot," said her
papa.</p>

<p>"Where?" said Alice. "In the water?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mr. Winter; "do you see that
small boat rowing towards us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa. Will he drop into that? He never
can; he will surely fall into the water."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter smiled and told her to go and watch
from the rail, which she did, and soon saw the
pilot go down the side of the steamer by a rope
<a class="pagenum" name="page_024" title="24"> </a>
and drop into the little row-boat, where two men
were waiting to row him to the pretty pilot-boat
No.&nbsp;4, which was quite a distance away.</p>

<p>The steamer started immediately, and in five
minutes the row-boat was only a speck on the
water.</p>

<p>"There is another hotel, papa. What is it?" said
Alice.</p>

<p>"That is the Long Beach Hotel, and you will
not see another until you reach Liverpool," said
her papa.</p>

<span class="small">LIFE ON A STEAMER.</span></h2>


<p>"Come, Alice," said Mrs. Winter, "we will go
down to our state-room and unpack our trunks
while we are in smooth water, for to-morrow morning
it may be so rough we cannot get out of our
berths at all."</p>

<p>Alice went with her mamma and helped put everything
in order, but there were so few hooks and no
bureau she did not know at first where to put anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter decided to sleep in the lower berth
and have Alice on the sofa, which gave them the top
berth for a bureau, and they found themselves very
comfortable.</p>

<p>Alice wanted to put some little things around to
look pretty, but her mamma said, "No, dear, for if
the ship rolls they will be all over the floor."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_026" title="26"> </a>
Alice laughed and said, "I guess the 'Etruria'
never rolls enough for that; she is too big."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," quietly said her mamma.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter said, "Now we will put on our warm
wraps and go on deck."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter had found their chairs and put them in
a nice place. Just as they were being settled in
them, the gong was sounded again. "That is for
lunch this time," said Mr. Winter, "and I for one am
glad, for I am very hungry."</p>

<p>On going to the saloon they were delighted to find
that their seats were at the captain's table, and any
one who has crossed the ocean with Captain Hains
knows what a treat they had before them, if it
should be a nice passage and he could be in his seat
at the head of the table.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the ship rolled, and when dinner
was announced Mrs. Winter thought she would take
hers on deck. She was not sick, but was afraid if
she left the air she might be. Mr. Winter and Alice
went to the table, and Alice was surprised to see the
vacant seats around the room. The racks were on
<a class="pagenum" name="page_027" title="27"> </a>
the table, so the dishes were held in place, but Alice
found it rather uncomfortable keeping her chair.</p>

<p>In the morning Mrs. Winter was too ill to leave
her berth, but Alice never felt better in her life. The
captain was so pleased to have her at the table to
breakfast he put her in her mamma's seat next to
him, and when she told him it was her birthday he
said, "You shall have a nice cake for your dinner."</p>

<p>After breakfast Alice went up on deck with Mr.
Winter, who put her in a comfortable place and
covered her up nice and warm. He went down to
see his wife.</p>

<p>The sea was a deep, bright blue, with lovely white
caps, and when the sun shone on them Alice could
see a rainbow on every wave.</p>

<p>Alice became tired of sitting in her chair, and went
to the rail to look over the side and see how pretty
the water looked as the ship cut through it. Soon
the young girl whom she had seen the day before
came up to her and said, "Have you ever crossed
before?"</p>

<p>Alice said, "No, have you?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_028" title="28"> </a>
"Oh, yes, several times; and I do enjoy every
minute, for I am never sick."</p>

<p>Alice asked her name, and she answered, "Nellie
Ford. What is yours and where are you going?"</p>

<p>Alice told her name and that she was going to
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "I have never been there. We are
going to Brussels, and it is such a beautiful city."</p>

<p>They talked on until the gong sounded, and
agreed to meet again after lunch.</p>

<p>At dinner that night Alice found the cake which
the captain had promised her on the table. After
thanking him, she asked if she might send a piece
of it to her new friend.</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear," said the captain. "It is
yours to do with just as you please."</p>

<p>The second day was very much like the first,
only Mrs. Winter was able to be on deck, and
Nellie Ford introduced her to Mr. and Mrs. Ford,
and they soon settled to a little party of six, as
passengers on a steamer are very apt to do.</p>

<p>The two girls were together all the time, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_029" title="29/30"> </a>
<a class="pagenum" name="page_030"> </a>
joined in a game of ring toss with some more of
the young people.</p>

</div>

<p>The days passed away, one very much like
another&mdash;some pleasant, some stormy and rough,
some foggy, with the whistles being blown every
two minutes. Alice felt that she should be glad
when she saw land again.</p>

<p>One night they met a steamer, and it did look
very pretty all lighted up. The "Etruria" set off
Roman candles, which were answered by the steamer,
and Alice thought that was the most interesting
evening of all, even more so than the night of
the concert.</p>

<p>The "Etruria" made a very quick trip, and
reached Queenstown Friday afternoon. Alice was
writing letters in the saloon to send home, when
suddenly the steamer stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, what is the matter?" she cried, jumping
to her feet. A gentleman sitting near her said,
"It is a fog, and as we are very near Fastnet
Rock they do not dare to go on."</p>

<p>Soon a gun was heard in answer to the steamer's
<a class="pagenum" name="page_031" title="31"> </a>
whistle, and the gentleman said, "We must be right
there now."</p>

<p>Alice went up on deck rather frightened, but as
suddenly as the fog had settled upon them it
lifted, and directly ahead of them was the straight
rock rising out of the water like a sentinel.</p>

<p>The "Etruria" ran up her signal flags and then
started on, and in three hours was off Queenstown
Harbor, where the tug was waiting for their mails
and the few passengers who wished to be landed.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_032" title="32"> </a>
CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="small">A FIRST GLIMPSE OF ENGLAND.</span></h2>


<p>Queenstown was soon a thing of the past, and
when they went to their rooms the packing
was finished, so that the next morning all the time
could be spent upon the deck until they landed.</p>

<p>It was a clear, bright morning, but very cold
and windy, when the steamer was left to take the
tug. On leaving the tug, Alice and Nellie were
very careful to each put her left foot first on the
dock, as they had been told it would bring them
good luck.</p>

<p>There was not much to interest our party in
Liverpool except the docks, which of course Alice
had been told were the finest in the world. After
leaving the Custom House they were driven to the
North Western Hotel, and the ladies and two girls
waited in the parlor in front of an enormous soft-coal
<a class="pagenum" name="page_033" title="33"> </a>
fire, while Mr. Ford and Mr. Winter went
into the station, which joins the hotel, and engaged
a compartment for London.</p>

<p>Opposite the hotel they could see St. George's
Hall, with its two statues in front, one of Queen
Victoria and the other of her husband, Prince
Albert, when they were young.</p>

<p>Suddenly a noise of horses being rapidly driven
was heard, and the girls ran to the window just
in time to see the high sheriff's carriage of state
being driven to the hotel to take him away to open
court. It was very elegant, with its satin linings
and the four beautiful horses.</p>

<p>The footmen stood up at the back of the carriage,
holding themselves on by leather straps. Four men
in uniform stood in the street and blew on trumpets
until the sheriff was out of sight.</p>

<p>The girls thought it very interesting, but Mrs.
Winter said, "A sheriff's position in England must
be very different from that in America, where they
usually go about in the quietest manner possible."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter and Mr. Ford came in and told them
<a class="pagenum" name="page_034" title="34"> </a>
it was time to get some lunch. A very nice one
they had, and Alice was particularly interested in the
table on wheels, with the joints of meat on it,
which was pushed about to each person to select the
cut of meat he liked.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford advised their going to the Hotel Victoria
in London, as he had tried many others and
liked that one the best; so they had telegraphed for
rooms before starting on the two o'clock train.
All the party were in good spirits, and glad to be
on dry land.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter and Alice did not like the carriage,
as it is called in England, as well as the drawing-room
car at home, but enjoyed every moment of
the journey.</p>

<p>England is like a large garden, every portion
being under cultivation; the fields are so green and
full of large, beautiful sheep grazing everywhere.</p>

<p>"O mamma, how much more lovely the hedges
are than our fences and walls at home!" said
Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Winter. "I have always
<a class="pagenum" name="page_035" title="35"> </a>
heard they were lovely, but I did not think they
would add so much to the beauties of the landscape."</p>

<p>Harrow, with its school on the hill, was passed,
and caused some interest to the girls. London was
reached before they realized it, and they were driven
to the Hotel Victoria in two four-wheeled cabs
called "growlers"&mdash;why, they did not know, unless
people "growl" at their lack of comfort in every
way; no springs, narrow, high seats, generally dirty,
and a worn-out old horse, whipped the most of the
time by a very poor driver.</p>

<p>Their rooms were ready for them, and glad enough
they were to get their dinner and go to bed to get
rested for the following days, to which the Winters
were looking forward with great interest.</p>

<h2 class="nopagebreak margtopsmall">CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="small">A WEEK IN LONDON.</span></h2>


<p>Sunday our party rested, but on Monday morning
they started for Westminster Abbey, hardly looking
at anything on the way, though they went by
Trafalgar Square, with the high column erected to Nelson,
which stands there so proudly, with its beautiful
lions made by Landseer lying so quietly at its base.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_037" title="37"> </a>
A pleasant morning was passed at the Abbey, and
the Poets' Corner proved to be their greatest attraction,
as it is with most Americans. The chair in
which Queen Victoria sat when she was crowned
was shown to them, but Alice said she thought it
was a common-looking chair, and wondered why the
Queen did not have one that was more imposing.</p>

<p>On leaving the Abbey they naturally turned towards
the Houses of Parliament, and wishing to get
even a better view, they walked part way over
Westminster bridge, where they also saw St. Thomas's
Hospital, situated on the Surrey side of the Thames.</p>

<p>The walk back to the hotel by way of the Embankment
was very pleasant, with its large buildings
one side, and the river with its boats moving up
and down on the other, and the rumble of the underground
railroad beneath their feet. On reaching
home they were so tired it was decided to rest in
the afternoon and visit Madame Tussaud's wax-works
in the evening.</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Ford said, "How would you like
to go to the wax-works by the underground railway?
<a class="pagenum" name="page_038" title="38"> </a>
It is not very far, if you think you won't
mind the smoke and confined air. The station is
very near, and we shall be left at the next building
to the wax-works. I have been driven there and it
only took about twenty minutes, so I think we can
go by train in ten."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mr. Winter; "it will be a good
opportunity to see how we shall like it."</p>

<p>Off they all started to the Charing Cross station.
The girls did not like going down underground so
far, but Alice said to Nellie, "I think I will not
say much about it unless mamma does."</p>

<p>After passing three stations, Mr. Winter said, "This
air is stifling, do you not think we are nearly there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Ford, "I think it must be
the next station."</p>

<p>When they reached it, it was not theirs, and Mr.
Ford called out to the guard, "How many more
stations before we reach Baker Street?"</p>

<p>The man looked at him rather queerly, and said,
"Fourteen. Where did you get on the train?"</p>

<p>"At Charing Cross," said Mr. Ford.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_039" title="39"> </a>
"Oh," said the guard, "you have taken a train for
the outer circle and come the longer way; some one
should have told you."</p>

<p>The train moved on, and our party had nothing
to do but sit patiently and try not to think how
close and stifling the air was getting.</p>

<p>When they were once more in the fresh air Mr.
Ford said, "Driving in cabs suits me pretty well,
and that is the way I am going home, if I go
alone."</p>

<p>There was not a dissenting voice, and after a very
pleasant evening they had a lovely drive home in
three hansom cabs, and it only took them sixteen
minutes.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning was spent in visiting the Bank
of England and St. Paul's Cathedral, where the
young people and the gentlemen went upstairs to
the Whispering Gallery.</p>

<p>They all went down to the Crypt, where are many
tombs, among them those of Nelson and Wellington.</p>

<p>The great object of interest to them was the
immense funeral car which was made to carry
<a class="pagenum" name="page_040" title="40"> </a>
the body of the Duke of Wellington through the
streets of London to his last resting-place.</p>

<p>The wheels were made from pieces of cannon
picked from the field of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford took them to a quaint, old-fashioned
place noted for its soups, for lunch.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Tower of London was
visited, and of course was of more interest to
the Winters than to the Fords.</p>

<p>To Alice it was very realistic, it was so full of
English history. She could tell her mamma much
more than could the man, in his strange costume,
who showed them around.</p>

<p>That night the ladies and the two girls were
too tired to go out again, so Mr. Ford took Mr.
Winter and they did a little sight-seeing on their
own account.</p>

<p>Wednesday was given up to visiting the Buckingham
Palace stables, where they saw the Queen's
famous ponies that are only used on state occasions;
and the South Kensington Museum, which
they found very interesting.</p>

</div>

<p>In the evening they went to the theatre, and
Alice thought it very strange to go downstairs to
their seats. The audience looked so much better
than in America, as the ladies were in evening
dress and the gentlemen in dress suits.</p>

<p>Thursday was a lovely day, and was spent at
Hampton Court. They went on the outside of a
coach, and what a lovely drive it was through
Richmond and Bushy Park, with its wonderful horse-chestnut
trees all in bloom!</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p042i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">HAMPTON COURT.</p>
</div>

<p>The coach stopped at a little inn beside the
river, where they lunched before visiting the famous
<a class="pagenum" name="page_043" title="43"> </a>
court, once the home of Henry the Eighth, and
presented to him by Cardinal Wolsey. It is now
the home of certain ladies of small income who
are alone in the world. They are selected by the
Queen, and of course have only one portion of the
palace.</p>

<p>The remainder is occupied as state apartments
and a famous picture-gallery, beside a gun-room
only second in interest to that of the Tower.</p>

<p>Friday was given to Windsor Castle and the
Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Saturday they shopped and visited the Royal
Academy, where they saw a beautiful collection of
paintings, and only wished there was more time
to spend looking at them.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ford decided to go with the
Winters as far as Brussels, and as they were
to start on Monday it was thought best to keep
very quiet on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter said to her husband she wished they
could stay longer in London, where every minute
had been a delight; but he said it was impossible.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_044" title="44"> </a>
CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="small">OFF FOR THE CONTINENT.</span></h2>


<p>Monday morning was bright and clear, and
Mr. Ford said, "This looks like a pleasant
crossing of the Channel."</p>

<p>The ride in the cars to Dover was very interesting,
and the view of Canterbury Cathedral was
quite fine.</p>

<p>Quite a large boat was waiting for the train, and
the water looked so smooth Alice said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guess the people who are sick crossing this
Channel do not know much of ocean discomfort."</p>

<p>Like a good many travellers who see the Channel
for the first time, she thought it must always be
quiet.</p>

<p>It proved to be a very smooth trip, and only a
little over an hour was spent in crossing.</p>

<p>The train left Calais fifteen minutes after the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_045" title="45"> </a>
arrival of the boat, and the gentlemen bought nice
luncheons which were put up in baskets,&mdash;chicken,
bread and butter, and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>They found a good compartment, and away they
went, eating their lunch and enjoying the views from
the windows at the same time.</p>

<p>Belgium is called the garden of Europe, as vegetables
are raised there for all the principal cities.</p>

<p>The country is flat and rather uninteresting to
look at, but when one realizes that the willows
which surround the farms are used by the women
and children to make baskets which are sent all
over the world it becomes very interesting.</p>

<p>The land is divided by water wide enough for flat-bottomed
boats to be rowed about, that the farmers
may till their land and bring home the products in
them.</p>

<p>It seemed very strange to see women at work in
the fields, but Mr. Ford said they would get used
to that before they reached Nuremberg.</p>

<p>It was dark when the train drew in at the
station at Brussels, and they took a stage marked
<a class="pagenum" name="page_046" title="46"> </a>
"Grand Hotel," and were driven through the principal
street of the city. The shops were all lighted,
and the streets and sidewalks full of people.</p>

<p>Outside the restaurants little tables were set on
the sidewalks, and men and women were eating and
drinking.</p>

<p>It was a sight the Winters had never seen, and
it looked very strange to them.</p>

<p>"It is just like Paris on a small scale," said Mr.
Ford.</p>

<p>Excellent rooms were ready for them at the
hotel, as they had been telegraphed for by Mr. Ford,
who was in the habit of going there every year.</p>

<p>They had a delicious supper, and Mr. Winter
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is the best meal I have seen since leaving
America."</p>

<p>The ladies had found the cars very hard to travel
in, and were glad to go to their rooms.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Winter was so thoroughly used
up that Mr. Winter decided to stay in Brussels a
few days for her to get rested.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_047" title="47"> </a>
The girls were delighted, as they had become very
fond of each other and were dreading the separation.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p047i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">BRUSSELS BOURSE.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Ford had to go out on business, and Mrs. Ford
said she would entertain Mrs. Winter if Mr. Winter
would take the girls sight-seeing. They started on
their walk in high spirits, and found such wide, clean
streets, interesting shops, and large, handsome buildings.</p>

<p>The new Exchange just completed, and the Palace
<a class="pagenum" name="page_048" title="48"> </a>
of Justice, are two of the most magnificent civic
buildings in Europe.</p>

<p>They were much interested in a lace manufactory.
On the lower floor were women at work on the
finest patterns. They were all ages, from twenty to
seventy, and never looked up while their work was
being examined.</p>

<p>When the girls were leaving the room, Alice
laughed at some remark of Nellie's, and then every
head was lifted and a sad smile came on each face
for a second.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter bought two lace handkerchiefs for the
girls to take as presents to their mothers.</p>

<p>Through the remainder of their stay in Brussels
they had lovely drives in the beautiful park, visited
the Palace of Justice, situated at the end of a long
street, on a hill where there was a glorious view
of the surrounding country for miles.</p>

<p>They also found that the picture gallery had a
very fine collection&mdash;indeed, said to be the best in
Belgium, and the pictures were beautifully arranged
in schools and periods.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_049" title="49"> </a>
One day was given to the field of Waterloo, which
they all enjoyed very much.</p>

<p>Alice felt so unhappy to be parted from Nellie
that Mr. Winter finally persuaded Mr. and Mrs.
Ford to let Nellie go with them to Nuremberg, as
it would give her a delightful trip, and she was
equally miserable to be left in Brussels without
Alice.</p>

<p>It was decided to meet in Paris, have an enjoyable
week together, and sail for home on the
"Etruria" near the middle of July.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_050" title="50"> </a>
CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="small">UP THE RHINE.</span></h2>


<p>On Monday, Mr. and Mrs. Winter and the girls
said "good-bye" to Mr. and Mrs. Ford and
started for Cologne in the gayest of spirits.</p>

<p>The trip was found very interesting, as they followed
the Meuse River a great deal of the way.
Between Liège and Verviers the country was wonderfully
picturesque, with the pretty winding river,
which they continually crossed, and little villages
with the mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>The Meuse has been called the miniature Rhine.</p>

<p>Verviers is the last Belgian station, and Aix-la-Chapelle
is the first town of much interest in
Germany.</p>

<p>From the train there was an excellent view of the
city, which has seen many changes since it was the
favorite home of Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="illustration"><a class="pagenum" name="page_051" title="51"> </a>

  </a>
  <p class="caption">COLOGNE CATHEDRAL.</p>
</div>

<p>For more than three centuries
the German emperors were
crowned there.</p>

<p>It was growing dark as
Cologne was reached, but the girls, knowing the
cathedral was near the station, hurried outside to
see it, and how wonderfully high and beautiful the
noble great spires looked in the twilight no one
can imagine who has never seen them.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning was spent in visiting the Church
of St. Ursula (which is reputed to hold the bones
<a class="pagenum" name="page_052" title="52"> </a>
of eleven thousand virgins martyred by the Huns)
and the cathedral.</p>

<p>An excellent guide showed our party around, and
pointed out the beautiful windows which King Ludwig
presented, costing eighteen thousand pounds,
English money.</p>

<p>The late King Frederick gave one elegant window,
at the end opposite the entrance.</p>

<p>On one side of the building were windows made
by Albert Dürer, considered Germany's greatest artist.</p>

<p>A large gold cross, presented by Marie de Medici,
and costing an enormous sum of money, Alice
thought was more beautiful than the windows.</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel they met a company
of soldiers who were singing as they marched
along. It seemed very inspiring.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning this happy party took the
train for Mayence up the Rhine, as the boats, they
found, were not yet running.</p>

<p>Alice and Nellie had been reading up the legends
of the Rhine, and could hardly wait to see its
beauties and wonders.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_053" title="53"> </a>
The Rhine was not reached until after leaving
Bonn. The scenery was so pretty they did not miss
the river views.</p>

<p>In full view of the train was the famous avenue
of horse-chestnuts, three-quarters of a mile in length.
There is a large university at Bonn, and many
other schools. As many of the students in their
different costumes came to the station and walked
up and down the platform to show themselves, the
girls were very much amused.</p>

<p>The city is also noted as being the birthplace of
Beethoven.</p>

<p>As soon as Bonn was out of sight, the river was
beside them. At first the entire party were disappointed,
the river seemed so quiet, narrow, and
sluggish, compared to the rivers at home.</p>

<p>However, that was soon forgotten as its beauties
grew upon them.</p>

<p>They soon saw the Seven Mountains coming into
view, and wished they could stay over one night to
see the sun rise from the top.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter felt he must hurry on, as they had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_054" title="54"> </a>
spent so much time in Brussels, and see all they
could from the train.</p>

<p>At Oberwinter, where there is the finest view
down the Rhine, all the party looked back to see it.</p>

<p>Coblence was the next large town, and the situation
is beautiful, as it is at the confluence of the
Rhine and the Moselle, with the strong fortifications
opposite, the Castle of Ehrenbreitstein, often called
the Gibraltar of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Just after leaving Coblence they saw two castles,
one the royal castle of Stolzenfels on its "proud
rock," more than four hundred feet above the river.
It was destroyed by the French in the seventeenth
century, but is now completely restored.</p>

<p>The other castle is directly opposite, above the
mouth of the Lahn river, is called the Castle of
Lahneck, and has been lately restored. Alice knew
the legend of this castle, and told it to the rest
of the party.</p>

<p>"It was here, in the beginning of the fourteenth
century, that the order of Knights Templars, which
had been founded for religious purposes chiefly, was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_055" title="55"> </a>
severely persecuted by Philippe le Beau of France
and Pope Clement&nbsp;V.</p>

  LAHNECK CASTLE.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_054">54</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"After many vicissitudes there was a long and
desperate siege, in which all the knights fell except
one man. He held the commander at bay, who
was so overpowered by the knight's bravery he
<a class="pagenum" name="page_056" title="56"> </a>
offered him life and liberty if he would stop fighting
and beg for mercy.</p>

<p>"The templar's only answer was to throw his
spear among the soldiers, and then was killed by
throwing himself on their lances."</p>

<p>Boppart was the next town of any interest, it
being a walled town of Roman origin.</p>

<p>The wall had crumbled away in many places,
and houses had been built on the ruins.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the river was Bornhoffen,
with its twin castles of Sternberg and Liebenstein,
or "The Brothers."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter told this legend, which runs that
once a rich knight, with his two sons and one daughter,
lived there, and were very rich in gold and lands,
which the old knight had gained through wrong
and robbery. All his neighbors felt sure that such
ill-gotten wealth would bring him anything but
blessings.</p>

<p>The brothers inherited the avarice of the father;
but the sister was lovely and gentle, like her
mother. When the father died the brothers gave
<a class="pagenum" name="page_057" title="57"> </a>
their sister much less than a third of the property.
She gave hers to the cause of religion and went
into a convent.</p>

<p>The brothers, disappointed, disputed over their
share, and at last fell in love with the same
maiden, who did not hesitate to flirt with both
and increase their jealousy. They finally fought and
killed each other.</p>

<p>Just as Mr. Winter finished his story, the guard
of the train put his head into the car window, to
say that the Lorely rock was nearly in sight.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_058" title="58"> </a>
CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="small">THE LEGEND OF THE LORELY.</span></h2>


<p>Both girls jumped to their feet, for of course
they were interested to see that famous rock
where the water-nymph Lore was said to have lived.
She would appear on the top of the rock, clothed
in wonderful garments, and a veil of the color of
the sea-green water reaching to her feet, to lure
wicked people to destruction by her singing.</p>

<p>The people who came to the foot of the rock
were swallowed in the waves, while those who
tried to climb to the top were either thrown back
into the water or led through the dense woods,
only to be days finding their way out of them.</p>

<p>Lore was very kind to good people, having the
fairy power of distinguishing good from evil.</p>

<p>At last a young count, much to his father's unhappiness,
saw and fell in love with her. He constantly
<a class="pagenum" name="page_059" title="59"> </a>
went to gaze upon her, for she was very
beautiful.</p>

<p>He used to carry his zither and play and sing
to her, until she finally caused the waves to rise
so high that his boat was upset and broken. The
count sank into the waves, and his attendants returned
home to tell the father the sad news.</p>

<p>The old count swore revenge, and was going to
seize Lore and have her burnt. The next night he
took some friends and surrounded the rock.</p>

<p>When Lore appeared the old count said, "Where
is my son?"</p>

<p>Lore pointed to the waves, at the same time
continuing to sing very sweetly.</p>

<p>As soon as Lore had finished her song, she
threw a stone into the river, which caused a wave
to rise. She mounted it and sank from view with
it, never to be seen again, though her singing
was often heard by men passing by.</p>

<p>The rock was formerly called Lorely, but is now
Lurlei, and has a lovely echo said to be the gift
of Lore.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_060" title="60"> </a>
The girls were disappointed to see the water around
the rock so very quiet&mdash;no whirlpool at all.</p>

<p>When they saw that a cut had been made
through the rock for railroad trains, all the romance
was gone for them.</p>

<p>Alice said, "O papa, how could anybody spoil
that pretty story by running trains through the rock?
If that is the way my romances are going to end
I will not read any more."</p>

<p>However, she soon saw a house built in the river,
and wanted to know what it was and why it was there.</p>

<p>"I know," said Nellie. "I was reading about it
the other day."</p>

<p>It is called the Pfalz, and was built by Louis of
Bavaria in the thirteenth century, in order to exact
tribute from passing vessels.</p>

<p>Opposite is the town of Bacharach, the Ara Bacchi
of the Romans, and has long been famous for its wines.
In Longfellow's "Golden Legend" is the old rhyme,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse extraindent">"At Bacharach on the Rhine,</div>
      <div class="verse">At Hochheim on the Main,</div>
      <div class="verse">And at Würzburg on the Stein,</div>
      <div class="verse">Grow the three best kinds of wine."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_061" title="61"> </a>
The Bacchus-Altar is to be found in this lovely
country. It stands just below the town, but the
water has to be very low to read the inscription
(which is nearly illegible), as it is situated between
the bank of the river and an islet.</p>

<p>The Altar is supposed to have been erected by
the Romans to their god of wine.</p>

<p>Many other castles, some restored, but the most
of them in ruins, were passed, before Assmanshausen,
famous for its red wines, was reached.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said, "Now this ends what is called
'the great gorge of the Rhine,' and the river will
broaden, and the open country, not very interesting,
is before you."</p>

<p>Just before reaching Bingen they saw the ruins
of Ehrenfels, and in the middle of the river the
Mausthurm, or "Mouse Tower."</p>

<p>"O papa, I know the story of that tower," said
Alice. "Can I tell it?"</p>

<p>"We are only too glad to hear it," said her
mamma.</p>

<p>"Hatto was Bishop of Fulda, and wishing to be
<a class="pagenum" name="page_062" title="62"> </a>
made Archbishop of Mayence, used every means in
his power to accomplish his purpose. He succeeded,
and became very ambitious, proud, and cruel. He
taxed the poor to build for himself fine dwellings.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p062i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  MOUSE TOWER.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_061">61</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"At last he built the tower in the river where it
was very narrow, to compel all ships to pay him toll.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_063" title="63"> </a>
"A famine set in, and he, having plenty of money,
bought up everything and filled his granaries. He
sold his stores at such high prices that only the
rich could buy.</p>

<p>"He paid no heed to the supplications of the
famishing people, as he intended building a superb
palace with his money.</p>

<p>"One day when Hatto was entertaining friends at
dinner, the starving people forced their way into the
dining-hall and begged for food. He told them to
go to a large barn where corn should be given
them. When they were all inside, Hatto ordered
the doors to be closed and fastened on the outside
and the barn to be set on fire.</p>

<p>"When their shrieks reached the dining-hall, Hatto
turned to his guests and said, 'Hear how the corn-mice
squeal: I do the same to rebels as I do to
them.'</p>

<p>"The wrath of Heaven was turned against him, for
out of the ashes at the barn thousands of mice took
their way to the palace, filling the rooms and attacking
Hatto. Thousands were killed, but they steadily
<a class="pagenum" name="page_064" title="64"> </a>
increased, and he was finally obliged to flee in terror
of his life to a boat, still pursued by legions.</p>

<p>"Hatto was ferried over the Rhine to the tower, but
the mice perforated the walls, and fell on him by
the thousands, and ate him up. They then disappeared,
and the tower has been called the 'Mouse
Tower' ever since.</p>

<p>"It has never been used in any way, but stands as
a warning to despotic people."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said, "Alice, you told that very well;
but he was not such a very wicked man as the
legend makes him. He was imperious and caused
his people much suffering, but was the Emperor's
confidant and was called the Heart of the King."</p>

<p>Bingen is not a very interesting town, but has
many walks and drives that are full of interest in
every way.</p>

<p>Directly opposite, on the heights of Niederwald, is
the beautiful monument built to commemorate the
restitution of the German Empire in 1870-1871.</p>

<p>Alice and Nellie did wish they could stop long
enough to go up and see it, it looked so grand and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_065" title="65"> </a>
mighty outlined against the sky. Mr. Winter said,
"No, we must get to Mayence to-night."</p>

<p>There was not much of interest after leaving
Bingen, as the train left the river and the Rhine was
not seen again until just before entering Mayence,
where the Main flows most peacefully into it, making
a very beautiful picture.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_066" title="66"> </a>
CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="small">MAYENCE TO NUREMBERG.</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Winter as usual had telegraphed to Mayence
for rooms, and found very comfortable,
large rooms ready for them in a new, pleasant hotel
near the station.</p>

<p>After resting a little while Mr. Winter said, "Who
wants to go with me and take a drive around the
city?"</p>

<p>The entire party, even Mrs. Winter, who had
thought she was too tired to go out again, said they
would like to go.</p>

<p>What a delightful drive they had, at the close of
a warm, lovely day, around that interesting old city,
with its wonderful fortifications! The view of the
rivers at the base of the hill they thought as pretty
as any they had seen all day.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter told them what a very old city it was,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_067" title="67/68"> </a>
<a class="pagenum" name="page_068"> </a>
a Roman camp having been laid there thirty-eight
years before Christ.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p067i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  MAYENCE&mdash;GENERAL VIEW.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_065">65</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The foundations may be said to date from fourteen
years B.C., when Drusus built his extensive fortifications.
There is a Roman monument forty-five feet
high erected in honor of Drusus. There are also
remains of a Roman aqueduct to be found outside
the city.</p>

<p>The cathedral was founded in 798. It has been
burnt and restored six times, and is one of the
grandest in Germany.</p>

<p>Just outside the cathedral they saw a fine statue
of Gutenberg, who is regarded by the Germans as
the inventor of movable types for printing.</p>

<p>Our party drove back to the hotel, had a nice
supper, which was waiting for them, and went to
bed feeling they had enjoyed that day more than
any since leaving home.</p>

<p>The next morning all were rested and eager to
get to Nuremberg, the end of the trip. Mr. Winter,
by some mistake, did not get the fast train, and as
the one they took stopped very often, and the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_069" title="69"> </a>
scenery was not very interesting, our party arrived
in Nuremberg so tired they ate their supper and
went directly to bed.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_070" title="70"> </a>
CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="small">NUREMBERG.</span></h2>


<p>In the morning Mr. Winter said, "I will give
one day to you for sight-seeing, and then I must
attend to business. You will have to spend the rest
of your time going around with a guide or by
yourselves."</p>

<p>Alice was delighted with the old moat which was
opposite her window, and wanted to look in it at
once.</p>

<p>Nellie felt the castle was of more importance, and
could hardly wait to get there. The moat surrounds
the old city, and now is rented to gardeners, who
live in the old towers and cultivate the land in
the moat.</p>

<p>Our party started out to walk until they were
tired, and kept on the sidewalk side of the moat,
and thought it did look so pretty with everything
<a class="pagenum" name="page_071" title="71"> </a>
so fresh and green. The cherry-trees were all white
with their lovely blossoms, which grew even with
the sidewalk.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p071i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">NUREMBERG WALLS.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally they went through an old gateway, which
was said to be the one where a rope was kept in
the olden time, to use on the bakers. If they did
<a class="pagenum" name="page_072" title="72"> </a>
not give full weight, the bakers were tied to the
end of a pole and dipped into the water several
times. If poison was found in the bread, they were
immediately drowned.</p>

<p>As the ladies were getting tired, Mr. Winter called
a carriage to drive them to the castle. As he
could speak German, the driver told him many interesting
things, and pointed out various objects of
interest. He showed them one house that had been
occupied by the same family for four hundred and
fifty years.</p>

<p>The churches of St. Sebald and St. Lawrence they
admired very much on the outside, leaving the
beauties of the interiors for another day. They
passed one fountain called the Goose Man, and
another, the Beautiful Fountain, built in 1385. Also,
a fine statue of Hans Sachs, erected in 1874, who
was known through Germany as the cobbler-poet.
It was from his life Wagner wrote the opera of the
"Meistersinger."</p>

<p>Soon the driver drew up his horses at a corner
where a small house stood under a hill, called the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_073" title="73/74"> </a>
<a class="pagenum" name="page_074"> </a>
Sausage Shop, for its wonderfully cooked sausages.
It has been made famous by such men as Albert
Dürer, the great artist, Hans Sachs, and the old
burgomasters meeting there for their nightly mugs
of beer and a sausage.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p073i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  ALBRECHT DÜRER'S HOUSE.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_074">74</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The statue of Albert Dürer, erected in 1840, is
between the Sausage Shop and his old home. All the
houses, with their deep, slanting roofs, were objects
of interest, but most of all was that of Albert
Dürer, which is the only house in Nuremberg that
has not undergone some alteration.</p>

<p>The house is now filled with many curiosities,
some of them having belonged to Albert Dürer, and
is open every day to visitors. The girls wanted to
stop and go in at once, but Mr. Winter said, "No,
we cannot stop now; we must get to the castle,
and leave the house until we have more time."</p>

<p>The castle stands very high, and they were
obliged to drive up through very narrow and steep
streets; but the horses were used to it, and Mrs.
Winter finally overcame her nervousness.</p>

<p>When the top of the hill was reached, there was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_075" title="75"> </a>
a plateau where a beautiful view of the city was
to be seen. They left the carriage here, and after
looking at the scenery they walked on up to the
castle.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p075i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">NUREMBERG CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>On the way they saw a small shed, and, on looking
in, found it held the famous well. A young
<a class="pagenum" name="page_076" title="76"> </a>
girl was there, who, in a parrot sort of way, told
them that the well was built in the eleventh century,
under Conrad&nbsp;II., by convicts, and that it took
thirty years to finish it. She told Mrs. Winter to
hold a mirror in her hand while she lowered a
candle, to show by the reflection in the mirror the
depth of the well. It took just six seconds for
water which she poured out of a glass to reach the
water in the well. She told them it was four hundred
and fifty feet deep, and they all believed her.</p>

<p>In the courtyard of the castle they saw an old
linden tree growing, which is said to have been
planted by Empress Kunigunde eight hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>The castle they found quite interesting without
being very elegant. A lady in charge of it told
them many things of interest about the castle and
the city.</p>

<p>She told them that the first records of Nuremberg
date from 1050. In 1105 the town was besieged,
conquered, and destroyed by Henry&nbsp;V., again
besieged in 1127 by Emperor Lothar, from which
<a class="pagenum" name="page_077" title="77"> </a>
time imperial officials appeared who took the title of
Burggrafer.</p>

<p>Frederick&nbsp;I. (Barbarossa), under whom the burg
was enlarged, frequently lived here from 1156 to
1188. Rudolph von Hapsburg held his first diet here
in 1274, and often visited the town.</p>

<p>Under Emperor Karl&nbsp;IV. the first stone bridge
was built, and the streets were paved.</p>

<p>The first fundamental law of the empire was
formed by him, and is known as the "Golden
Bull." It was framed in Nuremberg in 1356, and
is still kept in Frankfort.</p>

<p>According to this law, every German emperor was
obliged to spend his first day of government in
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>His government was very favorable to Nuremberg
in every way.</p>

<p>The four large towers were built 1555 to 1568,
after a plan designed by Albert Dürer. The town
reached its highest artistic development in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, under such men as Albert
Dürer, A.&nbsp;Krafft, Herman Fischer, and many others.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_078" title="78"> </a>
Goblets and many such objects of art were made
here at that time. In 1649 Nuremberg displayed its
last splendor. Commerce had been ruined by different
wars. In 1806 it was made a matter of rejoicing
when it came under the crown of Bavaria.
King Ludwig first revived art, and trade made a
start.</p>

<p>In 1835 the first railroad was opened to Fürth.
In 1855 King Max&nbsp;II. with his family lived here,
and the Imperial Burg was offered to him as a
present by the town.</p>

<p>The lady also told them that the five-cornered
tower, which is the oldest building in Nuremberg
and connected with the castle, contained a collection
of instruments of torture. Among them is the iron
virgin, a figure of a woman, which opens and is
full of spikes. The poor victim would be shut up
in its clutches.</p>

<p>None of our party felt like visiting that horrible
place, so they thanked the woman, and took some
last looks at the beautiful views to be seen from
the windows. To their surprise they found it was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_079" title="79"> </a>
noon-time, and as everything in Nuremberg is closed
for an hour and a half at mid-day, they were
driven back to the Wurtemberger Hof, their comfortable
hotel, where everything possible was done
for their pleasure.</p>

<p>After a good dinner and a rest, Mr. Winter said
he thought, as his time was so limited, he would
like to visit the Town Hall and St. John's Cemetery.
A guide was found, and they started out with
more enthusiasm than ever.</p>

<p>The guide told them that the Town Hall was
built in the years from 1616 to 1619, in Italian
style. He pointed out to them a fine picture by
Paul Ritter, painted in 1882, to represent the act
of the arrival of the German Emperor's Insignia in
Nuremberg. The guide also showed them several
pictures of Dürer's representing the triumphal procession
of Emperor Maximilian. His pictures are,
many of them, very indistinct.</p>

<p>They were taken into a room where the wedding
couples go to sign their marriage contracts.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter was more interested than the girls,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_080" title="80"> </a>
and Mrs. Winter was so tired they were glad
enough to get in the carriage and be driven to the
famous old cemetery.</p>

<p>For some blocks before reaching the entrance are
paintings of Christ, representing the last days of his
life.</p>

<p>At the gateway are the three statues of Christ
and the two thieves nailed to the cross.</p>

<p>The guide showed them the graves of Dürer and
Sachs, and one of a man who had been killed,
while asleep, by his wife hammering a nail in his
head. There was a bronze skull, with the nail in
it just where she killed him.</p>

<p>Another interesting bronze was the figure of a
woman with a lizard on a perch, which, when
touched, turns towards the woman's figure and shows
where she was bitten in the neck by the lizard
that killed her.</p>

<p>The girls thought that very quaint and more
interesting than any they saw, though there were
many very beautifully carved, and, being of bronze,
were of great value.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_081" title="81"> </a>
While our party was wandering through the cemetery
a funeral was taking place, and as the entire
service was intoned, it was very impressive.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said as they entered the carriage,
"You have had enough sight-seeing for to-day, and
we will drive home and talk over all the wonderful
and interesting things we have seen and heard
to-day."</p>

<p>The following morning Mr. Winter left the ladies,
who walked aimlessly, not caring much where
they went, it was all so full of interest to them.</p>

<p>Accidentally they visited quite an interesting place
called the Preller House. It was built three hundred
years ago by a Venetian nobleman, and is now
<a class="pagenum" name="page_083" title="83"> </a>
used as a furniture warehouse. There is a chapel
in it, and some of the old furniture still remains.</p>

<p>The ceilings are very fine, and in two of the
rooms were only discovered when the present occupants
were having gas-pipes put in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter did not come home to dinner, and in
the afternoon Mrs. Winter and the girls went to
the Museum, where they found more to interest them
than anywhere they had been. It had a very large
and interesting collection of paintings and antiquities,
but the girls enjoyed seeing the old cloister&mdash;the
first they had ever seen.</p>

<p>That evening when Mr. Winter came home, he
told his wife that he should only be obliged to remain
one more day, and they must entertain themselves
again without him.</p>

<p>The next morning Mrs. Winter took a guide with
them, as she wished to visit some of the shops
where they could collect some curiosities.</p>

<p>They also went to the Market square, where the
poor people can buy everything they need at very
reasonable prices.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_084" title="84"> </a>
Mrs. Winter then said, "Now, girls, we will visit
those churches of which we have only seen the outside."</p>

<p>The guide took them first to St. Lawrence's Church.</p>

<p>This church, he told them, was mentioned as early
as 1006, and had the handsomest artistic decoration
of any of the celebrated churches throughout Germany.
The finest portion is the choir, with a vaulted
roof supported by slender pillars from which the
arches are formed like palm branches.</p>

<p>The guide wished them particularly to look at the
Gothic bronze chandelier, which weighs four hundred
and eighty-two pounds, and was cast by Peter Vischer
in 1489.</p>

<p>The girls were charmed by the seven windows of
the choir, which are considered the best examples of
Nuremberg glass-painting from 1450 to 1490. The
last window, called the Emperor's, was presented by
the citizens of Nuremberg in memory of the restitution
of the German Empire. It was put in the
22d of March, 1881. Mrs. Winter was much interested
in some beautiful tapestries representing the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_085" title="85"> </a>
lives of St. Lawrence and St. Catharine, and are
over four hundred years old.</p>

<p>There were many more paintings of much interest,
some of them Albert Dürer's. As they were leaving,
the girls saw some richly carved chairs by the doors,
and asked the guide why they were there.</p>

<p>He told them that they formerly belonged to the
guilds, and the masters sat in them, in turn, to
receive alms.</p>

<p>From this church our party was driven to St.
Sebaldus's, which was finished in the tenth century.
One of the most interesting things they saw was
the font, which was remarkable not only as the first
product of Nuremberg's foundries, but as having been
used to christen King Wenceslas of Bohemia, in 1361.</p>

<p>There were more paintings of Dürer's to be seen
here, but the finest work was the sepulchre of St.
Sebaldus in the centre of the choir. It is the most
extensive work German art has ever produced, and
was cast by Peter Vischer and his five sons.</p>

<p>"It was commenced in 1508 and completed in
1519. It rests on twelve snails, having four dolphins
<a class="pagenum" name="page_086" title="86"> </a>
at its corners, the whole forming a pagan temple
adorned with the Twelve Apostles. It is surmounted
by twelve smaller figures, and finally by an infant
Christ holding a globus in his hand, the latter being
a key of the whole monument, when it is to be rent
asunder. There is also a fine portrait of Peter Vischer
in this church."</p>

<p>Of course there were many more objects of interest
to be seen, but Mrs. Winter thought they had
seen enough; so they were driven home to dinner.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they took a drive out of the
city to a beer-garden situated at the side of a
pretty lake. They had some tea, and walked on the
borders of the lake quite a distance. Mrs. Winter
said, "I wish we had such a quiet, pretty place near
home where we could spend an afternoon as delightfully
as we have here."</p>

<p>That evening Nellie said, "Dear Mrs. Winter, how
can I ever thank you and your husband for this
trip? Mamma could not have come, and never shall
I forget what I have enjoyed through your kindness."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_087" title="87"> </a>
Mrs. Winter told her that the pleasure she had
given them was more than hers, as it had added
so much to Alice's happiness.</p>

<p>Alice said, "Now, mamma, will you not add to our
pleasures by repeating Longfellow's beautiful poem
on Nuremberg before we go to bed?"</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Winter, please do," said Nellie. "I
have never heard of it, but I know it must be very
lovely."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mrs. Winter. "I certainly never
knew a more appropriate time to recite it than now."</p>

<p>The girls gathered around her in the twilight as
she sweetly commenced:&mdash;</p>

"How very beautiful!" said Nellie. "Thank you
so much, Mrs. Winter, for reciting it to us. I
shall learn it myself when I get home, trusting I
may sometime give as much pleasure to another as
you have given me."</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said, "Why, Agnes, I never heard
you recite that poem so well."</p>

<p>"I never did," said his wife; "for I never truly
felt it before."</p>

lovely poem which has put our best thoughts into

<span class="small">STRASBOURG.</span></h2>


<p>Mrs. Winter was very anxious to travel to
Paris by the way of Strasbourg, as she had
always wished to see the cathedral with its wonderful
clock.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter made inquiries and found that was
decidedly the best way to go, which was a great
delight to them all.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_092" title="92"> </a>
Our party left Nuremberg early in the morning,
sorry to see the last of the most interesting city
they had seen thus far on their trip. Nellie, who
was looking forward to meeting her father and
mother in Paris, was quite happy to make a move
in that direction.</p>

<p>The first part of the trip was not very interesting,
but the latter was delightful, and as they had
a compartment to themselves the girls could enjoy
the view from both sides of the train. A change
of cars was made at a place where there was
hardly anything but the station and the railroad
interests. Here they ate a cold lunch from the
counter, though there were some hot dishes on a
table; but they did not look very tempting.</p>

<p>The spire of the Strasbourg Cathedral could be
seen some time before reaching the station, and well
it might, being four hundred and sixty-six feet high,
and by some authorities said to be the highest in
the world.</p>

<p>The fortifications had been so fine at Mayence
our party was surprised to find others much finer
<a class="pagenum" name="page_093" title="93"> </a>
here, many of them being new, having been built
at the time of the French and German war in
1870.</p>

<p>The engineering of some of them is particularly
fine, as they are made to be opened, so that all the
surrounding country can be flooded if necessary.</p>

<p>The train wound round the city, giving them a
fine view of the fortifications and the soldiers being
drilled in many of the enclosures.</p>

<p>Strasbourg was one of the most important cities
during the last war, and a great portion of it was
destroyed. One side of the cathedral was badly
damaged, but is now thoroughly restored.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter took his family to a small hotel on
the square near the station, having been recommended
there by the manager of the hotel at Nuremberg.
He found it very comfortable, and every
possible attention was shown them.</p>

<p>Arriving about five o'clock, there was plenty of
time to be driven around the city. Of course they
started for the cathedral, but on the way the driver
stopped the carriage to point out one of the highest
<a class="pagenum" name="page_094" title="94"> </a>
chimneys on one of the tallest houses, where the
storks had built a nest.</p>

<p>He also told them how the storks arrive every
spring and build their nests, and then leave in the
fall with their young, to return the next spring
with their families no larger nor smaller than when
they go away. What becomes of the surplus is a
great question&mdash;whether they only increase sufficiently
to fill the vacancies caused by death or old age, or
that the young ones found colonies in other countries.</p>

<p>The storks are held in great reverence by mankind,
and are never harmed. Indeed, it is considered
good fortune to the inmates of a house when a
nest is built on one of its chimneys.</p>

<p>The driver told a story of one man who gave
up the use of his room an entire winter, rather
than destroy a nest which two storks had built
over the top of his chimney, and thus prevented
his building a fire.</p>

<p>As they approached the cathedral Alice said,
"Why, papa, where is the clock? I cannot see it
at all."</p>

<div class="illustration">

  <p class="caption">
  STRASBOURG STORKS.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_094">94</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>"I do not know," said Mr. Winter; "but it certainly
is there somewhere."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_096" title="96"> </a>
The driver took them to the front of the building,
where they were met by a guide, who showed
them the beauties of the outside architecture and
the many statues of the apostles and saints. He
told them that the cathedral was commenced in
1015 and finished in 1601.</p>

<p>The guide showed them the plateau half-way up
the height of the steeple, and told them that it
is used by men who watch for fires all the time.
The citizens are so proud of the cathedral that they
have it dusted and washed inside very frequently.</p>

<p>"Where is the clock?" said Mrs. Winter, as soon
as the guide stopped talking long enough for her
to speak a word.</p>

<p>The man did not answer, but took them around
to a side door, where, after receiving his tip, he
left them and walked away.</p>

<p>At first they did not know what to do, but
Mrs. Winter said, "I think we had better go inside
if we can."</p>

<p>In they went, and right by the door was the
clock. A fine-looking man dressed elegantly met
<a class="pagenum" name="page_097" title="97/98"> </a>
<a class="pagenum" name="page_098"> </a>
them. He proved to be a finely educated Swiss,
and he explained the various wonders of the clock.</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p097i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">
  STRASBOURG&mdash;CATHEDRAL CLOCK.&mdash;<i>Page</i> <a href="#page_096">96.</a></p>
</div>

<p>He told them that the clock was built three
hundred years ago, and was to run a certain number
of years. It shows all fête days for all those
years, tells the changes of the moon, eclipses&mdash;in
fact, everything that one could imagine.</p>

<p>The apostles do not all come out and walk
around except at noon, but as it was quarter before
six our party saw three men move.</p>

<p>The clock stops at six at night and then commences
again at six in the morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter said the longer she looked at it, the
more wonderful it seemed to her that any man
could think of so many things.</p>

<p>The guide also told them that the man who first
conceived the idea of the clock became totally
blind when it was nearly completed. Of course he
could work no more, and it was never thought the
clock would be finished.</p>

<p>He lived thirty years, and after his death another
man was found who thought he could complete it.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_099" title="99"> </a>
He succeeded, and was paid by the government for
his time and work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter said, "I think it is the most wonderful
thing I ever saw, and I do not know which
man I admire the most&mdash;the one who conceived such
a work, or the man who could carry out such marvellous
thoughts of a man whom he had never met."</p>

<p>After leaving the cathedral our party was driven
around the city. The old part they found very quaint
and picturesque, with its high and sloping roofs. The
new part, built by the Germans, was very handsome,
some of the buildings, like the palace, conservatory
of music, and the post-office, being particularly fine.</p>

<p>The driver told them that one of the great interests
there was the making of <i>pâté de foie gras</i>.
It is made from the livers of geese which are fed
in such a way that the liver grows abnormally large,
often weighing three pounds.</p>

<p>He also told them that many of the French
people are still very bitter against the Germans, even
pulling down their shades to the windows if a regiment
should march by the house.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_100" title="100"> </a>
On their return to the hotel, the manager told
Mr. Winter he would have a very quick and comfortable
journey to Paris if he took the Orient
express which runs between Constantinople and Paris.
It would leave Strasbourg three hours later than the
ordinary train, and would arrive in Paris some hours
before it.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter engaged a compartment at once, and
the next day had a very enjoyable trip, though it
was a very long one. The first part of the route,
over mountains and through ravines, was very delightful;
but after getting into France it was flat
and uninteresting.</p>

<p>They passed through Epérgny, which was interesting
for its vines, which covered the fields for many
miles. From these grapes champagne is made.</p>

<p>Paris was reached at six o'clock, and their hotel,
which had been recommended by friends, was found
to be very homelike.</p>

<p>The Fords were there waiting for them, and
were as glad to see Nellie as she was glad to be
with them again.</p>




<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page_101" title="101"> </a>
CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="small">HOMEWARD BOUND.</span></h2>


<p>That evening after Nellie had told her mamma
some of her pleasant experiences, Mr. Winter
said, "Now we have just five days to spend in Paris,
and you must decide what you would most like to
do. Mr. Ford and I are entirely at your disposal."</p>

<p>Guidebooks were brought out and studied, and
after many discussions their plans were settled for
each day.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning they went to the Louvre,
feeling there would be so many pictures to see they
had better visit it first.</p>

<p>How tired they did get sliding around on those
slippery floors, trying to see the nine miles of pictures,
many of which were quite uninteresting to
them all.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. Winter took his wife and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_102" title="102"> </a>
the girls in a carriage, and started for the Bois de
Boulogne. When the Place de la Concorde was
reached, with its monolithic obelisk of Luxor, and
fountains and statues, with the gardens of the
Tuileries one side, and the Champs Élysées on the
other, the girls both exclaimed, "How beautiful!"
but Nellie added, "When I think of all the horrors
that have taken place here it loses some of its loveliness
to me."</p>

<div class="illustration">
  <img src="images/p102i.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">PLACE DE LA CONCORDE.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_103" title="103"> </a>
The drive through the Champs Élysées they
thought very beautiful, and when they reached the
Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, the most beautiful in
the world, their admiration knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said, "Alice, what do you know about
this?"</p>

<p>Alice answered that "It was commenced by
Napoleon&nbsp;I. in 1806 and finished by Louis Philippe,
and cost over two millions of dollars. It is about
one hundred and fifty feet high, and the same in
breadth, and the central arch is ninety feet high."</p>

<p>"Very good, my dear; you know that lesson very
well," said her papa.</p>

<p>From there to the Bois everything was full of
interest to them, and the drive around the Cascade
Alice thought particularly lovely.</p>

<p>Nellie said, "It is not kept up as nicely as I like
to see a park. They had better make Central Park a
visit, and see its nicely cut lawns and trimmed bushes."</p>

<p>On their way home they were driven through the
Place Vendôme, with its magnificent column in the
centre.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_104" title="104"> </a>
Nellie said, "I can tell you a little about that,
Mr. Winter, if you would like me to."</p>

<p>"Of course I should," said Mr. Winter.</p>

<p>"It is one hundred and forty feet high, and was
also built by Napoleon&nbsp;I. It was pulled down by
the Communists in 1871, but has since been restored."</p>

<p>The girls felt quite at home historically in Paris,
as all these interesting things were very fresh in
their minds.</p>

<p>In the evening, being very near the Palais Royale,
which was built for Cardinal Richelieu, they thought
it would be a pleasant way to pass their evening
to go and walk around and gaze into the shop
windows. The ladies were too tired, so the gentlemen
took the girls, and they had a delightful time.
Alice told her mamma on her return that she enjoyed
it, but did not care to go again; she had seen
so much jewelry, all alike, that it was actually
tiresome.</p>

<p>Friday morning they drove to the Palais du Luxembourg,
which has been prison, palace, senate-house,
and is now noted for its sculptures and paintings.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_105" title="105"> </a>
Our party enjoyed it much more than the Louvre,
as the paintings were so many of them modern and
very familiar to them.</p>

<p>At the back of the garden they saw the statue
of Marshal Ney, on the very spot where he was
shot.</p>

<p>Being on that side of the river, they visited the
Church of the Hôtel des Invalides to see the tomb
of Napoleon&nbsp;I. It was directly under the dome,
and the softened lights all around made it very
beautiful.</p>

<p>After being driven home and having lunch, they
walked to the Madeleine, the most magnificent of
modern churches.</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter said, "This is very beautiful, but I
do like the solemnity of some of the older churches
I have seen very much better."</p>

<p>Leaving there, they walked through some of those
wide and interesting boulevards, watching the people
and carriages and gazing into the fascinating
shop-windows.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford said, "I thought I had seen in New
<a class="pagenum" name="page_106" title="106"> </a>
York some florists' windows that could not be improved,
but I find I was mistaken. Never have I
seen such windows as these."</p>

<p>When too tired to walk any farther, carriages
were called, and they were driven to the Cathedral
of Notre Dame, built on an island in the Seine;
from there to the Panthéon, which Alice said "looked
like a barn, and was cold and inhospitable."</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about it was, that such
celebrated men as Victor Hugo, Marat, Voltaire,
Mirabeau, and Rousseau had been buried there.
The Hôtel de Ville, recently restored, they passed
on their way home.</p>

<p>The evening was given to the Hippodrome, which
is quite the thing to do in Paris, and is wonderfully
fine.</p>

<p>The drive there was like a picture of fairyland,
with the bright lights and trees and glimpses of
the river.</p>

<p>Saturday was devoted to shopping, a great deal
of it being done at the Magasin de Louvre and the
Bon Marché. The buildings are immense, and there
<a class="pagenum" name="page_107" title="107"> </a>
is everything to be found in them that one could
possibly desire.</p>

<p>That evening it was decided to go to the opera
at the Grand Opera House, the most beautiful one
in the world. The girls were so excited they could
not eat any dinner, for it was their first appearance.</p>

<p>Faust was the opera given, and a wonderful ballet
followed it. Between the opera and ballet they all
went outside and looked down at the men on horseback,
stationed like sentinels outside the building.</p>

<p>Before them was the whole length of the Rue de
l'Opera a blaze of light. Alice said, "Nothing yet
has been as delightful as this evening."</p>

<p>Sunday was bright and clear, much to the delight
of our sight-seers, as they were going to Versailles.
They decided on Sunday, as the fountains were advertised
to play, and all were very anxious to see
them.</p>

<p>They drove there and enjoyed every moment, especially
when passing St. Cloud. They saw all it was
possible to see in one day, but felt as if it was
very little, after all.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_108" title="108"> </a>
They went through the palace as fast as they
could, but any one knows who has been there that
with those glossy floors it took time.</p>

<p>The room devoted to war pictures they did not
care for, but were much interested in Marie Antoinette's
private rooms, which were so very small, and
also in the place where the Swiss Guards were
killed in defending her.</p>

<p>The state apartments were very elegant, especially
the Galerie de Glace, where the German emperor
was proclaimed emperor in the late war.</p>

<p>Of course the girls were eager to get to the
Great and Little Trianon. They were disappointed
in the size and simplicity of their furnishings. The
rooms, however, were so full of historical interest
that their disappointment was forgotten, and they
thought they could have spent all their time in the
two houses.</p>

<p>In the coach-house were seen some very curious
old state coaches used by Charles&nbsp;X. and Napoleon&nbsp;I.
and many other sovereigns.</p>

<p>The man in charge was almost as much of a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_109" title="109"> </a>
curiosity as the coaches, he told his stories in such
an interesting manner, laughing heartily at his own
jokes.</p>

<p>The drive home was delightful, but they were all
too tired to say very much. After a good dinner,
the two girls talked as fast as magpies over the
delights of the day. Being like most girls, Marie
<a class="pagenum" name="page_110" title="110"> </a>
Antoinette was one of the most interesting characters
in French history, and they talked of her and
her sad life, feeling almost as if they had lived a
portion of it with her, in the quiet retreat and
lovely gardens of Versailles.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter said to his wife, "I have really finished
my business this side of the water, and unless
you would like to remain in London three or four
more days for the 'Etruria,' we can catch the 'Teutonic'
next Wednesday."</p>

<p>Mrs. Winter said she would like to go home on
the "Teutonic" very much, but did not like to
leave Mr. and Mrs. Ford, as they had made all
their arrangements to go home together.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford said, "We are delighted to shorten the
trip, as I ought to be at home now; but we did
not like to break up the party."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Winter. "We will go out
and telegraph to Liverpool for state-rooms."</p>

<p>Alice said to her mamma, "I wonder if we can
like the 'Teutonic' as well as we did the 'Etruria'
that brought us over the seas so safely."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_111" title="111"> </a>
Monday was devoted to visiting the Salon, where
they saw so many pictures that they came away
with a very vague idea of what they had seen,
but all agreed they preferred the English pictures
of the present day to those of the French.</p>

<p>Tuesday night saw our party again in London,
but at the Savoy Hotel, where they had delightful
rooms overlooking the river.</p>

<p>Wednesday at eleven o'clock our happy party took
the special train which connects with the fast
steamers, and at four o'clock were on the "Teutonic"
and starting for home.</p>

<p>A lovely night down to Queenstown, where the
steamer stops for the mails. While waiting the next
morning, Mr. Winter and Mr. Ford took Alice and
Nellie on shore in the tug, and gave them a nice
drive in a jaunting car.</p>

<p>The girls did not enjoy the drive very much, but
were glad of the experience.</p>

<p>The ladies were very much interested in the boats
which came out to the "Teutonic" with women who
had laces and small articles to sell. The things
<a class="pagenum" name="page_112" title="112"> </a>
were sent up to the deck in baskets, on ropes,
which were tossed up for the passengers to catch.
Some of the Irish girls were very bright, and made
very good sales.</p>

<p>At last the tug with the mails arrived, and was
<a class="pagenum" name="page_113" title="113"> </a>
attached to the steamer at once. Both went down
the harbor until the passengers, among them our
party, and the mails had been transferred. The girls
were uneasy until they were with their mothers.</p>

<p>At two o'clock the tug left them, and then, indeed,
it seemed as if they had started for home.</p>

<p>One bad stormy day, some foggy and some delightful
ones, fell to their share. No one of their
party was sick, and they thought the steamer delightful.
Much as they had liked the "Etruria," it
was decided by all that the "Teutonic" would be
their steamer in the future.</p>

<p>New York was reached on Wednesday afternoon, and
at night the entire party was at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, feeling very glad to get safely across the
ocean again. They had become such good friends it
was very hard to separate.</p>

<p>However, a promise was made by the Fords to
visit Mr. and Mrs. Winter before the summer was
over.</p>

<p>Thursday night the Winters could have been found
in their own home, all very happy, and feeling that
<a class="pagenum" name="page_114" title="114"> </a>
the following years would be fuller of interest in
every way for the experiences, most of them pleasant,
of their charming trip to Nuremberg and
back.</p>
